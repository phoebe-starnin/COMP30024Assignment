    This is the entry point for your submission. You should modify this
    function to solve the search problem discussed in the Part A specification.
    See `core.py` for information on the types being used here.

    Parameters:
        `board`: a dictionary representing the initial board state, mapping
            coordinates to `CellState` instances (each with a `.color` and
            `.height` attribute).

    Returns:
        A list of actions (MoveAction, EatAction, or CascadeAction), or `None`
        if no solution is possible.

    # The render_board() function is handy for debugging. It will print out a
    # board state in a human-readable format. If your terminal supports ANSI
    # codes, set the `ansi` flag to True to print a colour-coded version!
    print(render_board(board, ansi=True))

    # Do some impressive AI stuff here to find the solution...
    # ...
    # ... (your solution goes here!)

    # Here we're returning "hardcoded" actions as an example of the expected
    # output format. Of course, you should instead return the result of your
    # search algorithm. Remember: if no solution is possible for a given input,
    # return `None` instead of a list.
